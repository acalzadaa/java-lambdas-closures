# Java Lambdas, Streams and Collections

This project is about learning by heart all there is to know about Lambdas, Streams, Collections, Defaults and Optional. This training is based in three awesome books: 

- Java Closures and Lambda
- Java-8-Lambdas
- Java 9 Language Features, 2nd Edition

And because I like TDD every exercise starts with a test using JUnit4 in such an extreme level that there are some exercises than contains only tests.
